# 0x0F. Load balancer
Letâ€™s improve our web stack so that there is redundancy for our web servers. This will allow us to be able to accept more traffic by doubling the number of web servers and to make our infrastructure more reliable.

This project sets up all two web servers with Nginx and installs a load balancer with HAProxy on a third server.

## Environment
- OS: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Language: Bash Scripts
- Web Server: Nginx
- Style Guide: Shellcheck
