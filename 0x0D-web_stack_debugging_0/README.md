# Web Debugging Project_0
In this debugging series, broken/bugged webstacks will be given to you, the final goal is to come up with a Bash script that once executed, will bring the webstack to a working state.

In this first debugging project, you will need to get Apache to run on the container and to return a page containing Hello Holberton when querying the root of it.
